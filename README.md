# Shelby-2.0
This is a template to seed Wan Automation Engine (WAE) and Network Services Orchestration (NSO) development work. The initial seeding modules are taken from the Cisco DevNet Learning Lab.  What I have done is basically clone the code snipets from Learning Lab into Github so the Shelby 2.0 team can start sharing development work.
